Like SIRI, but meet Liri! A Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface that can do some cool stuff.
You can use these commands to get what you want: 
`movie-this`, `concert-this`, `spotify-this-song `, `do-what-it-says `.

<br>`movie-this` allows you to pull information about a movie.

<br>`concert-this` allows you to see information about where and when an artist is performing.
