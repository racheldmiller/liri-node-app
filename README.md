Like SIRI, but meet Liri! A Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface that can do some cool stuff.
You can use these commands to get what you want: 
`movie-this`, `concert-this`, `spotify-this-song `, `do-what-it-says `.

`movie-this` allows you to pull information about a movie. 
`concert-this` allows you to see information about where and when an artist is performing.
`spotify-this-song` allows you to see results for a song.
`do-what-it-says` ... to be continued. 

(So far, only the OMDB and the Bands in Town are working perfectly. 
I also have screenshots but I'm not too sure how to add in screenshots).
